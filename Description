Project Description:
IMPORTANT!!! project was build following FreeCodeCamp video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImtZ5yENzgE),
but since it was an old video with Laravel ver of 5.8, i made my own changes according to the new version (laravel 11) etc
and instead of vue.js i used alpine.js, because it was inbuild in laravel breeze starter kit for blade templates, which i use for auth system.

This project is a simplified version of Instagram, built with Laravel 11, Blade templates, and a little Alpine.js 
for interactivity. 
It provides a social media platform with essential features such as auth system, profile editing, image posting, and a follow system.

Features:
User registration and login system (using Laravel's built-in authentication).
Profile management: Edit additional information and profile picture.
Post pictures with titles.
Follow/unfollow users and search functionality.
Basic error handling and validation.

Tech Stack
Backend and Frontend: Laravel framework, Blade templates, Alpine.js + Tailwind for styling
